This carousel automatically advances without any pause or stop controls, violating WCAG 2.2.2 (Pause, Stop, Hide) and preventing users from reading content at their own pace.

## The issue

Users cannot control the carousel's auto-rotation, making it impossible for those with reading difficulties or cognitive disabilities to consume the content properly.
