## Fair Use & Copyright

This website operates under the principle of fair use for educational and
commentary purposes. Screenshots and examples are used to:

- Illustrate UX patterns and design principles
- Provide educational commentary and analysis
- Demonstrate best practices and common pitfalls
- Support learning and professional development

We believe our use of these materials constitutes fair use under copyright law,
as it serves educational purposes, provides commentary, and uses only the
necessary portions of the original works.

## No Criticism Intended

When we show examples of patterns that could be improved, it is not our
intention to criticize the companies, teams, or individuals behind these
designs. UX design is complex, and what works in one context may not work
in another.

Our goal is to foster learning and discussion about UX patterns, not to
pass judgment on specific implementations or organizations.
