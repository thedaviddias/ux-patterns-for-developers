title: About UX Patterns for Devs
---

**UX Patterns for Developers** is a free collection of UX patterns towards developers who want to understand how to build effective UI components accessible and usable.

It was created by [David Dias](https://thedaviddias.com).

## History

For the past few years, as a frontend developer, I have been studying and creating UI components for multiple different projects and applications. From simple personal projects, to large-scale enterprise applications, I have always been interested in UX patterns and how they can be applied to UI design.

UX is hard. It's a complex field that requires a deep understanding of the user's needs and behaviors. It's also a constantly evolving field, with new patterns and best practices emerging all the time.

I decided to create this project, as an evolving documentation of UX patterns for developers. With the help of the community, I hope to make it a valuable resource for developers looking to improve their UI design and UX.
