Progressive Loading is a performance optimization technique that loads content and resources gradually rather than all at once. This approach improves initial page load times and provides a better user experience, especially for users with slower internet connections.

## Key Concepts

- Content is loaded in stages or chunks
- Initial load focuses on essential content
- Additional content loads as needed
- Can be triggered by user actions or automatically

## Common Applications

- Image loading (thumbnails before full resolution)
- Paginated content loading
- Infinite scroll implementations
- Large data table loading

## Benefits

- Faster initial page loads
- Reduced server load
- Better user experience
- Improved perceived performance
