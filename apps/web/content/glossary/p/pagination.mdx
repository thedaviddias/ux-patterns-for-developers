Pagination is a fundamental user interface pattern that divides large sets of content into smaller, more manageable chunks called "pages". This pattern helps users navigate through extensive collections of data, such as search results, product listings, or blog posts.

- Maintains user orientation within large datasets
- Supports bookmarking and sharing specific pages

## Benefits

- Improves page load performance
- Reduces cognitive load on users
- Enables better content organization
