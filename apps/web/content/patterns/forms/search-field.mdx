## Overview

## Usage

A search can be used in the following cases:

- Global search on a website
- Reduce the number of results in a list (ex: dropdown with a list of elements)

Usually used in combinaison with [autocomplete](/patterns/forms/autocomplete)

## Search Field Considerations

- **Use `<input type="search">` instead of `<input type="text">`**â€”it improves browser behavior for search interactions.
- **Include a "clear" button** in search fields for usability.
- **Consider autocomplete functionality** to help users refine queries faster.
- **Ensure that hitting Enter submits the search** or triggers a relevant action.
