| **Migration Guide** | Upgrading from older approaches | When replacing legacy patterns |
| **Platform-Specific Considerations** | iOS/Android/Desktop differences | Cross-platform patterns |
| **Performance Optimization** | Detailed performance section | Heavy patterns (infinite scroll, virtualization) |
| **Comparison Table** | Comparing implementation approaches | When multiple valid approaches exist |
| **Implementation Checklist** | Quick reference checklist | Complex multi-step patterns |
| **Code Architecture** | Architectural decisions | Patterns requiring specific architecture |
| **Event Handling** | Event management strategies | Event-heavy patterns |
| **Deployment Considerations** | Production deployment notes | Patterns with deployment complexity |

## Section Writing Guidelines

### Overview Section
- Start with the problem the pattern solves
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences
- Include the primary use case

### Use Cases Section
- Provide 3-5 specific scenarios for "when to use"
- Include 2-3 anti-patterns for "when not to use"
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate

### Best Practices Section
Always organize into these subsections:
1. **Content** - Text, labels, messaging
2. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance
3. **Visual Design** - Styling, themes
4. **Layout & Positioning** - Responsive behavior
5. **Common Mistakes** - Anti-patterns with fixes

### Interactive Examples
- Start with a basic example
- Add advanced examples for complex patterns
- Ensure examples work in the Playground component

### Performance Section
Include when the pattern:
- Loads significant JavaScript (>10KB)
- Handles large datasets
- Uses animations
- Makes API calls
- Affects Core Web Vitals

### Security Considerations
Must include for patterns involving:
- User authentication
- Payment processing
- File uploads
- User-generated content
- Sensitive data display
- API keys or tokens

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Sections
When you identify a new section type:
1. Add it to the appropriate category above
2. Document when it should be used
3. Update the template if it becomes common
4. Add an example from an existing pattern

### Reviewing Patterns
When reviewing pattern documentation:
1. Check all required sections are present
2. Verify recommended sections are included or explicitly omitted
3. Ensure situational sections match the pattern type
4. Validate examples work in the playground

## Quick Reference Checklist

For every new pattern, ask:

- [ ] Does it handle user input? â†’ Add Validation Rules
- [ ] Does it connect to APIs? â†’ Add API Integration  
- [ ] Does it have animations? â†’ Add Micro-Interactions
- [ ] Is it replacing something? â†’ Add Migration Guide
- [ ] Does it handle errors? â†’ Add Error Handling
- [ ] Is it security-sensitive? â†’ Add Security Considerations
- [ ] Does it have multiple modes? â†’ Add Variations
- [ ] Is performance critical? â†’ Add Performance Optimization
- [ ] Does it work differently per platform? â†’ Add Platform-Specific
- [ ] Is the implementation complex? â†’ Add Implementation Checklist
