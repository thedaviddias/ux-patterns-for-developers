export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>
}
```

## Variants

Choose button variants based on visual hierarchy and importance. Primary actions should stand out, while secondary and tertiary actions progressively recede. This creates clear action paths and reduces cognitive load for users. Learn more about [button variations](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#button-variations).

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-variants" />

### Solid (Default)

The primary button style for main actions.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-default" height="h-[100px]" />

### Danger

Use for destructive actions like deleting data.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-destructive" height="h-[100px]" />

### Outline

A button with a border and transparent background.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-outline" height="h-[100px]" />

### Soft

For less prominent secondary actions.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-soft" height="h-[100px]" />

### Ghost

Minimal styling for tertiary actions.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-ghost" height="h-[100px]" />

### Link

Styled to look like a link but with button behavior.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-link" height="h-[100px]" />

### Success, Warning, Gradient & Glass

Additional variants for special use cases:

## Sizes

Button size affects touch targets and visual weight. Larger buttons are easier to click but take more space. Follow minimum touch target guidelines (44x44px on mobile) while balancing information density with usability. See [mobile considerations](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#mobile--touch-considerations).

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-sizes" height="h-[150px]" />

## Motion Effects

Subtle animations provide feedback and polish. Click effects confirm activation while hover effects preview interactivity. Use sparingly - motion should enhance clarity, not distract from the task. Read about [state variations](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#state-variations).

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-motion-effects" />

<Callout>
  **Motion Preference**: All motion effects automatically respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings. Users who prefer reduced motion will get instant feedback without animations.
</Callout>

## States

Clear state indicators prevent user confusion and repeated clicks. Loading states show progress, success confirms completion, and disabled states explain unavailability. Never leave users wondering if their action was registered. Learn about [state variations](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#state-variations).

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-states" />

### Loading States

Multiple loading indicators for different contexts:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-loading-states" />

### Disabled States

By default, the `disabled` prop uses `aria-disabled` for better accessibility (keeps button in tab order). Use `forceNativeDisabled` to apply the native HTML disabled attribute when needed:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-disabled" height="h-[150px]" />

<Callout type="warning">
  **Performance Note**: When using loading states, always provide feedback within 100ms to prevent users from thinking the button is broken. For actions taking longer than 3 seconds, consider showing progress indicators.
</Callout>

## Interactive Features

Multi-sensory feedback creates more engaging and accessible interactions. Haptics, sounds, and long-press gestures add depth to the user experience while maintaining accessibility for all users. Explore [accessibility guidelines](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#accessibility).

### Haptic Feedback

Add tactile feedback on mobile devices:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-with-haptics" height="h-[150px]" />

### Sound Effects

Provide audio feedback for interactions:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-with-sound" height="h-[150px]" />

### Long Press

Support long press interactions:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-long-press" height="h-[150px]" />

<Callout type="info">
  **Pro Tip**: Our enhanced button component includes advanced features like haptic feedback, sound effects, and motion animations that work seamlessly across all platforms. These features are opt-in and don't affect the core button functionality.
</Callout>

## With Icons

Icons improve scannability and reinforce meaning, making interfaces faster to parse. Always pair icons with text for clarity - icon-only buttons should be reserved for universally recognized actions and include proper labels for accessibility. See [content composition](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#content-composition).

<Callout>
  **Icon Guidelines**: Ensure icons are from the same family (e.g., all Lucide icons) for visual consistency. Mix-and-match icon styles create visual discord.
</Callout>

### Icon on the Left

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-icon-left" height="h-[150px]" />

### Icon on the Right

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-icon-right" height="h-[150px]" />

### Icon Only

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-icon-only" height="h-[150px]" />

### Double Icons

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-double-icon" height="h-[150px]" />

### With Icons (All Variations)

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-with-icons" />

## Layout Options

Button layout affects visual flow and interaction patterns. Full-width buttons work well in forms and modals, while button groups organize related actions. Consider thumb reach on mobile when positioning primary actions. Read about [layout & positioning](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#layout--positioning).

### Full Width

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-full-width" />

### Button Groups

Group related actions together:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-groups" />

<Callout type="info">
  **Design Tip**: Group related actions but limit to 3-4 buttons maximum. For more options, consider a dropdown menu to reduce cognitive load.
</Callout>

## Advanced Examples

Real-world buttons combine multiple patterns for specific use cases. These examples demonstrate practical implementations like social logins, payment flows, and confirmation actions that balance functionality with user experience.

### As Child

Use button styling with other components like links:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-as-child" height="h-[150px]" />

### With Badges & Notifications

Badges communicate status and urgency without cluttering the interface. Use sparingly to maintain impact - when everything is urgent, nothing is. Ensure proper contrast and accessibility for color-blind users.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-notification-badge" />

### With Counters

Social proof and engagement metrics build trust and encourage interaction. Keep counts readable with abbreviations (1.2k vs 1,234) and ensure real-time updates don't distract from the primary action.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-counter-inline" />

### With Avatar

Avatar buttons personalize the interface and provide quick access to account actions. The dropdown indicator clarifies that more options are available, preventing confusion about the button's purpose.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-with-avatar" height="h-[150px]" />

### With Keyboard Shortcut

Displaying keyboard shortcuts educates power users and improves efficiency. Show shortcuts subtly to avoid visual clutter while helping users transition from clicking to keyboard navigation.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-with-keyboard-shortcut" height="h-[150px]" />

### Confirmation Actions

Destructive actions need safeguards to prevent accidents. Inline confirmations work for low-risk actions, while modal dialogs better suit irreversible operations. Long-press alternatives reduce friction while maintaining safety.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-confirmation" />

**Component Composition:** For modal confirmations, combine with the Dialog component. The inline confirmation pattern shown here is suitable for less critical actions.

<Callout type="warning">
  **UX Best Practice**: Reserve confirmation patterns for destructive actions only. Overusing confirmations creates "confirmation fatigue" where users click through without reading.
</Callout>

### Social Buttons

Social login reduces friction and password fatigue. Display recognizable brand colors and icons to build trust, but offer traditional signup as an alternative for privacy-conscious users.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-social" />

### Payment Buttons

Payment buttons must inspire confidence through familiar branding and clear security indicators. Express checkout options reduce cart abandonment while maintaining trust through recognized payment providers.

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-payment" />

## Accessibility

Our button component includes comprehensive accessibility features by default:

<ComponentPreviewServer name="button-aria-features" />

<Callout>
  **Accessibility First**: Our button component prioritizes accessibility with comprehensive ARIA support, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. Learn more in the [Button Pattern accessibility guide](https://uxpatterns.dev/patterns/forms/button#accessibility).
</Callout>
