UP Kit is a comprehensive collection of UX patterns and UI components for developers who want to create exceptional, accessible, and usable interfaces.

Built with **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**.

## What is UP Kit?

UP Kit extends shadcn/ui by adding comprehensive UX patterns with implementation guides, accessibility-first approach, and usability best practices. Each pattern includes:

- **Implementation examples** with copy-paste code
- **Accessibility guidelines** following WCAG 2.2 standards
- **Common mistakes** and how to avoid them
- **Best practices** from real-world applications
- **Testing guidelines** for quality assurance

## Why UP Kit?

### For Developers

- **Copy-paste ready** - No complex setup or configuration needed
- **Framework agnostic patterns** - Use with any React-based framework
- **Well-documented** - Every component includes detailed documentation
- **Production ready** - Used in real applications serving millions of users

### For Teams

- **Consistent design** - Maintain UI consistency across your application
- **Faster development** - Ship features in days, not weeks
- **Reduced bugs** - Battle-tested patterns prevent common mistakes
- **Better collaboration** - Shared vocabulary between designers and developers

### For Users

- **Accessible by default** - Works for everyone, including users with disabilities
- **Performant** - Optimized for Core Web Vitals
- **Responsive** - Mobile-first approach that works on all devices
- **Intuitive** - Follows established UX patterns users already know

## How is UP Kit Different?

While shadcn/ui provides excellent component primitives, UP Kit adds the UX layer on top:

- **Complete patterns** instead of just components
- **Implementation guides** with real-world examples
- **Accessibility documentation** for each pattern
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Testing strategies** for quality assurance

Think of it as shadcn/ui + UX best practices + implementation guidance.
