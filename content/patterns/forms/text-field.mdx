# Text Field

<PatternPreview />

## Overview

A **Text Field** is a fundamental form input component that allows users to enter and edit text-based data. It is commonly used in **forms, search fields, authentication fields, and messaging interfaces**.

Text fields can accept single-line or multi-line input and may include additional features like placeholders, character counters, validation messages, and formatting assistance.

## Use Cases

### When to use:

Use a text field when you need users to input freeform text, such as:

- **Login and authentication fields** – Username, password, email.
- **Search fields** – Query inputs in search bars.
- **Forms and surveys** – Collecting names, addresses, or custom responses.
- **Messaging interfaces** – Chat applications and comment sections.
- **Data entry fields** – User-generated content like tags, descriptions, or reviews.

### When not to use:

- **For pre-defined options** – Use [dropdowns](/patterns/forms/selection-input), [radio](/patterns/forms/radio), or [checkboxes](/patterns/forms/checkbox) instead.
- **For structured data inputs** – Use specialized inputs like [date pickers](/patterns/forms/date-picker) or [currency fields](/patterns/forms/currency-input).
- **For short selections** – Use [auto-complete](/patterns/forms/autocomplete) inputs instead of requiring full text input.
- **When voice input or selections are better** – Consider alternatives for accessibility.

## Benefits

- **Flexible** – Allows users to enter freeform responses.
- **Widely recognized** – Standardized interaction that users expect.
- **Supports real-time validation** – Instant feedback for user input.
- **Can be enhanced** – Custom validation, auto-formatting, and assistance.

## Drawbacks

- **User errors** – Freeform text increases the risk of typos and incorrect formatting.
- **Lack of guidance** – May require placeholders, labels, or tooltips to improve usability.
- **Accessibility concerns** – Must be properly labeled and include validation feedback for screen readers.

```

### Component Structure

1. **Container (`div` or `fieldset`)**

   - Wraps the entire text field component.
   - Ensures proper spacing and alignment.
   - May include additional styling or group related inputs.

2. **Label (`label`)**

   - Describes the purpose of the input field.
   - Should be visually positioned above the input.
   - Must be **associated with the input** using the `for` attribute.

3. **Input Field (`input[type="text"]`)**

   - The interactive area where users enter text.
   - Supports attributes such as `autocomplete`, `maxlength`, and `required`.
   - Should have proper focus styles for accessibility.

4. **Placeholder (Optional)**

   - Provides a hint before users type.
   - Disappears when input is focused.
   - **Should not replace a label** for accessibility.

5. **Helper Text (`p` or `span`, optional)**

   - Provides additional guidance or formatting instructions.
   - Typically placed **below the input field**.
   - Should be **persistent** and not disappear on focus.

6. **Validation/Error Message (`<output>` preferred, `<p>` or `<span>` acceptable)**

   - Displays a **clear, specific message** when input is invalid.
   - **Use `<output>` for dynamic validation feedback** - semantically represents the result of user input.
   - Use `<p>` for static helper text that doesn't change.
   - Should be **associated with the input using `aria-describedby`**.
   - Appears below the input, replacing helper text if necessary.

7. **Character Counter (`p` or `span`, optional)**

   - Displays **remaining or used character count** (e.g., "20/100 characters").
   - Helps users stay within input length limits.
   - Should update dynamically as the user types.

8. **Prefix (`span`, optional)**

   - Static text **before the input** (e.g., `$` for currency, `@` for usernames).
   - Should be **visually distinguishable** from user input.

9. **Suffix (`span`, optional)**
   - Static text **after the input** (e.g., `.com` for domain fields).
   - Helps users understand **expected input formats**.

### Required Field Indicators

Best practices for marking required fields accessibly.

<Playground patternType="forms" pattern="text-field" example="required" />

### **Required Field Implementation Guidelines**

#### **1️⃣ Best Practice: Explicit "Required" Label**

✅ **Most accessible** – clear for all users, including screen readers.

```html
<label for="username"> Username <span>(Required)</span> </label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username" required />
```

**Pros ✅**

- Works for **all users**, including screen readers and color-blind users.
- No need for extra ARIA attributes.

**Cons ❌**

- Takes slightly more space in the UI.

#### **2️⃣ Alternative: Asterisk (\*) with ARIA Explanation**

✅ **Common practice**, but needs `aria-describedby` for screen reader users.

```html
<label for="username"> Username <span aria-hidden="true">*</span> </label>
<input
  type="text"
  id="username"
  name="username"
  required
  aria-describedby="required-msg"
/>
<p id="required-msg" class="sr-only">
  Fields marked with an asterisk are required.
</p>
```

**Pros ✅**

- Keeps UI cleaner while maintaining accessibility.
- Screen readers will announce **"Fields marked with an asterisk are required."**

**Cons ❌**

- **Requires additional explanation** (`aria-describedby`).
- **Without the extra message, asterisks alone are not accessible**.

#### **3️⃣ Alternative: Required Field with Visually Hidden Text**

✅ **Keeps UI minimal while ensuring accessibility.**

```html
<label for="email"> Email <span class="sr-only">(Required)</span> </label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
```

**Pros ✅**

- **Looks clean visually** while still accessible.
- **Screen readers announce it as "Email Required"**.

**Cons ❌**

- **Not visible for sighted users** who rely on visual cues.

#### **4️⃣ Alternative: Required Field with an Inline Icon + Tooltip**

✅ **More user-friendly**, provides additional guidance.

```html
<label for="phone">
  Phone Number
  <span aria-hidden="true" class="required-icon" tabindex="0"> *</span>
</label>
<input
  type="tel"
  id="phone"
  name="phone"
  required
  aria-describedby="required-msg"
/>
<p id="required-msg" class="sr-only">
  Fields marked with an asterisk are required.
</p>
```

**Pros ✅**

- **Visually clear** while keeping text minimal.
- Works well when paired with a **tooltip on hover or focus**.

**Cons ❌**

- **Requires CSS for styling** (ensuring asterisks are not the only indicator).
- Users **might not see tooltip hints** if they don't hover over the icon.

#### **5️⃣ Alternative: Required Field with `required` Attribute Only**

⚠ **Not recommended as a standalone solution!**

```html
<label for="password"> Password </label>
<input type="password" id="password" name="password" required />
```

**Pros ✅**

- Works well for **basic validation**.
- Screen readers **will announce the field as required**.

**Cons ❌**

- No **visible indicator for sighted users** before form submission.
- **Errors only appear after submission**, which may confuse users.
- Some browsers may **not enforce required fields consistently**.

## Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

#### Using Placeholder as Primary Label

**❌ What's Wrong?** Relying on placeholder text as the only label makes the field inaccessible when users start typing, and screen readers may not announce it properly.

```html
<!-- Bad: Placeholder as label -->
<input type="text" placeholder="First Name">
```

**How to Fix It?** Always provide a visible label and use placeholder for hints or examples only.

```html
<!-- Good: Label + helpful placeholder -->
<label for="firstName">First Name</label>
<input type="text" id="firstName" placeholder="e.g., John">
```

---

#### Poor Validation Timing

**❌ What's Wrong?** Showing error messages too early (on first keystroke) or too late (only on form submission) frustrates users.

**How to Fix It?** Use **progressive validation**:
- Show errors after field loses focus (onBlur) for first-time entry
- Show real-time validation for corrections after initial error
- Validate required fields on blur, format validation on input

```javascript
// Good: Progressive validation
function validateField(input, hasBeenBlurred) {
  if (hasBeenBlurred && input.value.length > 0) {
    // Show real-time validation after first blur
    showValidationFeedback(input);
  }
}
```

---

#### Missing Error Recovery

**❌ What's Wrong?** Not providing clear guidance on how to fix validation errors leaves users stuck.

**How to Fix It?** Include specific, actionable error messages with examples.

```html
<!-- Bad: Vague error -->
<output class="error">Invalid input</output>

<!-- Good: Specific guidance -->
<output class="error">
  Password must contain at least 8 characters, including 1 number and 1 special character. 
  Example: MyPass123!
</output>
```

---

#### Inaccessible Focus Management

**❌ What's Wrong?** Poor focus indicators or focus traps make keyboard navigation impossible.

**How to Fix It?** Ensure visible focus states and logical tab order.

```css
/* Good: Visible focus indicator */
.text-field input:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

## Best Practices

### **Content & Usability**

**Do's ✅**

- Provide a **clear and descriptive label**.
- Use **placeholder text sparingly** and never as a replacement for a label.
- Indicate **required fields** clearly and provide helpful validation feedback.
- Use **real-time validation** to prevent errors early.
- Ensure sufficient **touch target size** for mobile users.
- Allow users to **copy, paste, and autocomplete** when appropriate.
- **Use input masks sparingly**—they can improve formatting but may frustrate users if too rigid.
- Offer **formatting hints** when users must follow a specific pattern (e.g., phone numbers, dates).
- Provide **default values** when applicable to reduce typing effort.

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't use placeholder text instead of a visible label.
- Avoid long character limits without a counter.
- Don't require unnecessary or sensitive information without justification.
- Don't enforce **case sensitivity** unless absolutely necessary.
- Avoid disabling **copy-paste** for passwords or sensitive fields, as this can harm usability.

---

### **Accessibility**

**Do's ✅**

- Associate the text field with a `<label>` element for screen readers.
- Use `aria-describedby` to connect inputs to error messages or hints.
- Ensure **high contrast** between text and background.
- Provide **keyboard navigation** and support tabbing.
- Allow **speech-to-text functionality** for accessibility.
- Use `aria-invalid="true"` when a validation error occurs.
- Ensure **error messages appear next to the field** and are **read aloud by screen readers**.

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't remove focus outlines—they are essential for keyboard users.
- Don't rely solely on color to indicate errors.
- Avoid using `title` attributes for tooltips—use visible descriptions.
- Don't use `placeholder` as the only accessible text—it disappears when users start typing.
- Avoid **dynamic placeholder text changes** that may confuse assistive technologies.

---

### **Visual Design**

**Do's ✅**

- Use **sufficient padding and line height** for readability.
- Maintain a **clear distinction between active, focused, and disabled states**.
- Use **icons (optional)** for additional context (e.g., search icon in a search field).
- Ensure **error states are visually prominent** without being intrusive.
- **Use color contrast** that meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (e.g., 4.5:1 ratio for text).

**Don'ts ❌**

- Avoid excessive borders or decorative elements.
- Don't make the input field too small, especially on mobile.
- Avoid low contrast text and background combinations.
- Don't rely solely on placeholder text for field instructions.

---

### **Layout & Positioning**

**Do's ✅**

- Align labels **above or beside** the text field for clarity.
- Keep **consistent spacing and alignment** with other form elements.
- Ensure sufficient **spacing between multiple input fields** for easy readability.
- Place **validation messages near the input field** to improve error recognition.

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't position labels too far from the input.
- Avoid overly narrow text fields that cut off content.
- Don't place validation messages too far from the field.
- Avoid placing multiple fields **on the same line on mobile**, as this reduces readability.

### **Input Description Placement: Above or Below the Text Field?**

#### **Best Practice: Place Input Descriptions Below the Field**

In most cases, **input descriptions (helper text, formatting hints, and additional guidance) should be placed below the text field** for **consistency, readability, and accessibility**.

**✅ Why?**

- **Users scan from top to bottom** – The label is read first, then the input, then any additional help.
- **Aligns with error messages** – Since validation errors appear below the field, keeping all feedback in one place reduces cognitive load.
- **Screen reader order** – Screen readers will naturally announce the description **right after the field** when placed below.
- **Follows industry standards** – Major design systems (Google Material, IBM Carbon, Bootstrap) place helper text below.

---

#### **📍 When to Place Descriptions Above the Field?**

⚠ **There are some exceptions where placing descriptions above is preferable:**

1. **When users must understand something before typing**
   - Example: _"Enter your National Insurance number in the format QQ123456C"_
2. **Password requirements**
   - Example: _"Password must be at least 8 characters and contain a number."_
3. **When there is no error message below the field**
   - Helps avoid excessive space between the input and the next element.

---

#### **Best Practice: Only Show One at a Time**

To avoid overwhelming users:

- **Before an error occurs**, display helper text **below** the input.
- **When an error occurs**, **replace** the helper text with the error message.

✅ **Example (Best Practice)**

```html
<label for="email">Email</label>
<input
  type="email"
  id="email"
  name="email"
  required
  aria-describedby="email-info"
/>
<p id="email-info" class="helper-text">
  We'll never share your email with anyone.
</p>

<!-- Error message replaces helper text when validation fails -->
<p id="email-error" class="error-message" style="display: none;">
  Please enter a valid email.
</p>

<script>
  const emailInput = document.getElementById("email");
  const helperText = document.getElementById("email-info");
  const errorText = document.getElementById("email-error");

  emailInput.addEventListener("input", function () {
    if (!emailInput.validity.valid) {
      helperText.style.display = "none";
      errorText.style.display = "block";
    } else {
      helperText.style.display = "block";
      errorText.style.display = "none";
    }
  });
</script>
```

### **Final Recommendation for Input Description Placement**

| **Scenario**                                                   | **Where to Place Helper Text?** | **Why?**                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard input fields (e.g., email, name, search)**          | **Below**                       | Ensures consistency with error messages & better readability. |
| **Inputs with specific formatting (e.g., date, phone number)** | **Above**                       | Users need to understand format before typing.                |
| **Password fields (with complexity rules)**                    | **Above**                       | Users need guidance before they type.                         |
| **Large forms with minimal UI**                                | **Above** or **Inline**         | To prevent visual clutter.                                    |
| **Error messages**                                             | **Below**                       | Always below, ensuring users immediately see what went wrong. |

## Accessibility

### **Keyboard Interaction Pattern**

Text fields should support **standard keyboard navigation and interactions** to ensure accessibility and usability.

| **Key**                   | **Action**                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`                     | Moves focus to the next interactive element.                      |
| `Shift + Tab`             | Moves focus to the previous interactive element.                  |
| `Enter` _(inside a form)_ | Submits the form (unless prevented).                              |
| `Arrow Left / Right`      | Moves the text cursor within the input.                           |
| `Arrow Up / Down`         | Moves the cursor within multi-line text fields (`textarea`).      |
| `Esc`                     | If inside a **search field**, clears input _(optional behavior)._ |

## Micro-Interactions & Animations

For text field components, implement these specific animations to enhance user experience while maintaining performance:

### Focus Animation
- **Effect:** Smooth border color transition and subtle scale when field receives focus
- **Timing:** 200ms ease-out transition for professional feel
- **Implementation:** CSS transition on border-color and box-shadow properties

```css
.text-field input {
  border: 1px solid #d1d5db;
  transition: border-color 200ms ease-out, box-shadow 200ms ease-out;
}

.text-field input:focus {
  border-color: #3b82f6;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1);
}
```

### Validation State Animation
- **Effect:** Smooth color transition when switching between validation states
- **Timing:** 300ms ease-in-out to allow users to notice state changes
- **Implementation:** Animate border color, text color, and icon appearance

### Character Counter Animation
- **Effect:** Number increments smoothly and color changes as limit approaches
- **Timing:** 150ms for number updates, 200ms for color transitions
- **Implementation:** Animate color when reaching 80% (warning) and 95% (danger) of limit

### Label Float Animation
- **Effect:** Label moves from placeholder position to above field when focused
- **Timing:** 200ms ease-out for smooth, natural movement
- **Implementation:** Transform translateY and scale properties

## Tracking

Text field interactions provide valuable insights into user behavior, form completion rates, and usability issues. Track these key metrics to optimize the input experience.

### Key Tracking Points

| **Event Name** | **Description** | **Why Track It?** |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `textfield.focus` | When user focuses on a text field | Measures field engagement and interaction patterns |
| `textfield.input` | When user types in the field | Tracks active usage and input behavior |
| `textfield.blur` | When user leaves the field | Identifies completion patterns and field abandonment |
| `textfield.clear` | When user clears field content | Shows user correction behavior and field complexity |
| `textfield.validation_error` | When validation fails | Identifies problematic fields and error patterns |
| `textfield.validation_success` | When validation passes | Measures successful field completion |
| `textfield.paste` | When user pastes content | Shows copy-paste usage patterns |
| `textfield.autocomplete_used` | When browser autocomplete is used | Indicates field recognition and user convenience |

### Event Payload Structure

```json
{
  "event": "textfield.validation_error",
  "properties": {
    "field_name": "email",
    "field_type": "email",
    "error_type": "invalid_format",
    "input_length": 12,
    "time_spent": 4.2,
    "attempt_number": 2,
    "form_id": "registration"
  }
}
```

### Key Metrics to Analyze

- **Field Completion Rate** → Percentage of users who successfully complete each field
- **Error Rate** → Frequency of validation errors per field type
- **Time to Complete** → Average time users spend on each field
- **Abandonment Points** → Where users stop filling forms
- **Correction Patterns** → How often users backspace or clear fields
- **Paste Usage** → Fields where users commonly paste content

## Localization

Text fields require comprehensive localization support for international users, including text direction, input methods, and cultural formatting differences.

```json
{
  "text_field": {
    "validation": {
      "required": "This field is required",
      "invalid_email": "Please enter a valid email address",
      "invalid_format": "Please check the format",
      "too_short": "Must be at least {min} characters",
      "too_long": "Must be no more than {max} characters",
      "contains_invalid_chars": "Contains invalid characters"
    },
    "actions": {
      "clear": "Clear field",
      "show_password": "Show password",
      "hide_password": "Hide password",
      "copy": "Copy to clipboard",
      "paste": "Paste from clipboard"
    },
    "counter": {
      "characters_remaining": "{count} characters remaining",
      "character_limit_reached": "Character limit reached",
      "over_limit": "{count} characters over limit"
    },
    "states": {
      "loading": "Loading...",
      "success": "Valid",
      "processing": "Processing...",
      "saved": "Saved"
    },

      "email": "Enter your email",
      "password": "Enter your password",
      "optional": "Optional"
    }
  }
}
```

### RTL Language Support

For right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew), adjust text alignment and icon positions:

```css
[dir="rtl"] .text-field input {
  text-align: right;
}

[dir="rtl"] .text-field__prefix {
  order: 2;
}

[dir="rtl"] .text-field__suffix {
  order: 0;
}
```

### Input Method Support

Consider different input methods for international users:

- **IME Support:** Handle composition events for Chinese, Japanese, Korean input
- **Virtual Keyboards:** Optimize for mobile virtual keyboards with appropriate `inputmode` attributes
- **Cultural Formats:** Support local name orders, address formats, and phone number patterns

## Performance Metrics

Target performance metrics for text field components:

- **Initial render**: < 100ms for text field appearance
- **Focus response**: < 50ms from click to focus state
- **Validation feedback**: < 150ms after input validation
- **Character counter updates**: < 50ms for smooth counting
- **Memory usage**: < 5KB per text field instance

## **Testing Guidelines**

### **Functional Testing**

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Verify that users can input, edit, and delete text without issues.
- [ ] Ensure character limits work correctly and display remaining characters if applicable.
- [ ] Validate correct error handling and messaging (e.g., required fields, invalid formats).
- [ ] Confirm keyboard navigation and focus behavior, including tab order.
- [ ] Ensure users can **copy, paste, and autofill** without restrictions.
- [ ] Test **input masks and auto-formatting** to confirm they work as expected.
- [ ] Validate that pressing **Enter/Return** behaves as expected (e.g., form submission or moving to the next field).

---

### **Accessibility Testing**

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Ensure text fields have associated **labels (`<label for="id">`)** for screen readers.
- [ ] Validate that error messages are announced by **screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack)**.
- [ ] Confirm that **keyboard users can navigate and interact** effectively using `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Enter`, and `Esc`.
- [ ] Ensure **high contrast between text and background** (meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio).
- [ ] Check that **focus indicators are visible** when navigating via keyboard.
- [ ] Test with **different screen readers** to confirm field descriptions and validation messages are correctly read.
- [ ] Verify that **speech-to-text functionality works** for users relying on voice input.
- [ ] Ensure **placeholder text is not the only accessible label**, as it disappears when typing.
- [ ] Check for `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid="true"` usage in error handling scenarios.

---

### **Performance Testing**

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Ensure text input does not **cause delays, freezing, or slow response times**.
- [ ] Validate large text input handling (e.g., pasting 1000+ characters into a field).
- [ ] Check **browser compatibility across different devices** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, mobile browsers).
- [ ] Test mobile usability, including **touch input, autocorrect behavior, and focus handling**.
- [ ] Ensure input fields **don't trigger layout shifts** (Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS).
- [ ] Validate **lazy loading and deferred scripts** do not delay field interactions.
- [ ] Check memory usage when dynamically adding or removing fields.

---

### **Security Testing**

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Ensure fields do not store sensitive data in autocomplete history unless necessary (`autocomplete="off"` for sensitive inputs).
- [ ] Validate against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks**—inputs should sanitize user-entered data.
- [ ] Verify that error messages do not reveal sensitive details (e.g., don't display "Incorrect email or password" separately).
- [ ] Check that invalid inputs do not break the layout or cause unexpected behavior.

---

### **Mobile & Touch Testing**

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Ensure the **correct keyboard type appears** for each input (e.g., numeric for phone numbers, email keyboard for email fields).
- [ ] Validate touch targets are **large enough (at least 44x44px)** for usability.
- [ ] Test how input behaves in **dark mode** and ensure readability.
- [ ] Check if input fields adjust correctly when the **virtual keyboard opens** (avoiding overlapping content).
- [ ] Ensure users can **easily dismiss the keyboard** after typing (e.g., tapping outside the input).
- [ ] Verify that **autocorrect and autocomplete work properly** without interfering with expected input behavior.
- [ ] Confirm that **multi-line inputs (`textarea`) scroll correctly** without hiding text on smaller screens.

---

### **Error Handling & Validation Testing**

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Ensure validation errors appear **next to the relevant input field** (not in a separate section).
- [ ] Validate that **real-time validation** does not trigger prematurely while typing.
- [ ] Confirm that error messages **persist until fixed**, rather than disappearing too quickly.
- [ ] Ensure errors provide **clear guidance** (e.g., "Enter a valid email" instead of "Invalid input").
- [ ] Check if `aria-live="polite"` announces validation messages dynamically.
- [ ] Test behavior when **submitting an empty required field**—does it highlight correctly?
- [ ] Verify that server-side validation handles **unexpected input** gracefully (e.g., very long strings, special characters).
- [ ] Ensure users can **recover from errors easily** without refreshing the page.

---

### **Edge Case Testing**

**Should ✓**

- [ ] Simulate **slow network conditions** to check if validation messages delay input behavior.
- [ ] Test behavior when **copying and pasting large amounts of text** into a field.
- [ ] Ensure **input remains intact** when navigating away and returning to the form.
- [ ] Check how the field handles **emoji, special characters, and non-Latin alphabets**.
- [ ] Test what happens if a **user pastes an entire paragraph into a single-line text field**.
- [ ] Verify that auto-suggestions do not interfere with manual input.
- [ ] Test behavior when **users press the "back" button on mobile browsers**—does the input persist?
- [ ] Ensure users **can undo accidental deletions** (via `Ctrl+Z` or long press on mobile).
