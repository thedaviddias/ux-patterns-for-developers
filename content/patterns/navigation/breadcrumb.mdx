# Breadcrumb

<PatternStats 
  popularity="medium"
/>

<PatternPreview />

## Overview

**Breadcrumbs** display as horizontal link lists separated by symbols, helping users understand their website location at a glance.

Breadcrumbs work as secondary navigation aids showing users their current location and providing easy navigation back through parent pages.

Websites with deep hierarchical structures or complex navigation paths benefit most from breadcrumbs.

<BuildEffort
  level="medium"
  description="Requires structured navigation, ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-current`), and responsive handling for long paths."
/>

## Use Cases

### When to use:

Use **Breadcrumbs** to **show users their location within a website's structure and help easy navigation**.

**Common scenarios include:**

- Websites have multiple hierarchical levels (categories, sub-categories)
- Large or complex sites where users land on deep pages from search engines
- Systems rely on nested file or document organization (file explorers, project management tools)
- E-commerce stores use layered product categories

### When not to use:

- Single-level websites have flat structure
- Landing pages or homepages don't need them
- Small websites use simple navigation
- Hierarchy already shows through other navigation elements
- Single-page applications use modal-based navigation

### Common scenarios and examples

- E-commerce: Home > Electronics > Smartphones > iPhone 15
- Content Management: Dashboard > Projects > Project A > Documents
- File Systems: My Drive > Work > 2024 > Reports

### Component Structure

1. **Container (`nav`)**

- Wraps entire breadcrumb navigation
- Uses **semantic navigation elements** for accessibility
- Needs proper labeling for **screen readers**

2. **List (`ol`)**

- Holds **breadcrumb items** in sequential order
- Shows **hierarchical structure** of the page
- Usually an **ordered list** conveying structure

3. **Items (`li`)**

- **Home Link (Optional):** Starting point linking to homepage
- **Parent Pages:** Clickable links representing higher navigation levels
- **Current Page:** Final item that **shouldn't be a link** since it's the current view
- **Separators:** Visual dividers (`/`, `>`) showing clear navigation hierarchy

#### Summary of Components

| Component    | Required? | Purpose                                               |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Container    | ‚úÖ Yes    | Wraps the entire breadcrumb navigation.               |
| List         | ‚úÖ Yes    | Contains the breadcrumb items in order.               |
| Items        | ‚úÖ Yes    | Represents individual breadcrumb links.               |
| Separators   | ‚úÖ Yes    | Visually separates breadcrumb links.                  |
| Home Link    | ‚ùå No     | Provides an optional shortcut to the homepage.        |
| Current Page | ‚úÖ Yes    | Represents the active page (should not be clickable). |

## Best Practices

### Content

**Do's ‚úÖ**

- Use clear, concise labels that match page titles
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Show the full hierarchy path

**Don'ts ‚ùå**

- Don't use inconsistent terminology between breadcrumb items and page titles
- Don't truncate breadcrumb items without indicating there's more content

### Accessibility

**Do's ‚úÖ**

- Maintain the icon's accessibility by including proper aria-label
- Give users quick confirmation of where they are in the hierarchy
- Use semantic HTML elements

**Don'ts ‚ùå**

- Don't make the current page title clickable
- Don't use a breadcrumb if the user is already at the top level of the hierarchy

### Visual Design

**Do's ‚úÖ**

- Make it obvious that the last item is not clickable (through color, cursor type, etc.)
- Use consistent visual styling across all pages
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background

**Don'ts ‚ùå**

- Don't use distracting animations or transitions
- Don't make separators too prominent

### Layout & Positioning

**Do's ‚úÖ**

- Place the breadcrumb at the top of the page, below the global navigation and above the page title
- Keep the breadcrumb left-aligned
- Consider showing both icon and text on larger screens
- Consider showing a house icon instead of text "Home" on smaller screens

**Don'ts ‚ùå**

- Do not show a breadcrumb if the navigation's hierarchy contains only one level (home page or landing pages for example)
- Do not use an HTML element for separators but prefer using CSS

## Tracking

Tracking breadcrumb interactions helps measure how users navigate through a site, whether they rely on breadcrumbs for backtracking, and if they help reduce friction in multi-level navigation. By analyzing usage patterns, we can optimize the breadcrumb structure and placement.

### Key Tracking Points

Each breadcrumb interaction provides valuable insights into user behavior. Below are the key events that should be tracked:

| **Event Name**           | **Description**                                                    | **Why Track It?**                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `breadcrumb.view`        | When the breadcrumb component enters the viewport.                 | Determines visibility and whether breadcrumbs are available to users. |
| `breadcrumb.click`       | When a user clicks on any breadcrumb link.                         | Measures engagement and breadcrumb-driven navigation.                 |
| `breadcrumb.home_click`  | When a user clicks on the **home** link in the breadcrumb.         | Tracks how often users return to the homepage via breadcrumbs.        |
| `breadcrumb.level_click` | When a user clicks on an intermediate breadcrumb level.            | Helps assess whether users navigate back up the hierarchy.            |
| `breadcrumb.usage`       | Captures breadcrumb interaction data relative to total page views. | Helps measure how often breadcrumbs are used when available.          |

### Event Payload Structure

To ensure consistent tracking, here‚Äôs a recommended event format:

```json
{
  "event": "breadcrumb.click",
  "properties": {
    "breadcrumb_id": "product_category",
    "clicked_level": "Electronics",
    "breadcrumb_position": 2,
    "total_levels": 4
  }
}
```

### Key Metrics to Analyze

Once tracking is in place, the following metrics provide actionable insights:

- **Breadcrumb Usage Rate** ‚Üí Percentage of page visits where breadcrumbs were interacted with.
- **Breadcrumb Click-Through Rate (CTR)** ‚Üí Percentage of users who interact with breadcrumbs after seeing them.
- **Navigation Recovery Rate** ‚Üí How often users navigate up using breadcrumbs instead of the browser back button.
- **Home Click Rate** ‚Üí Measures how often users return to the homepage via breadcrumbs.
- **Intermediate Level Click Rate** ‚Üí Tracks how often users use breadcrumbs to navigate back to higher levels.

### Insights & Optimization Based on Tracking

By analyzing tracking data, we can optimize breadcrumb usability:

- üö® **Low Breadcrumb Usage Rate?**
  ‚Üí Users may not notice breadcrumbs or find them unnecessary.
  **Optimization:** Improve visibility, adjust styling for better contrast, or test a more prominent placement.

- ‚è≥ **Low Breadcrumb Click-Through Rate?**
  ‚Üí Users see breadcrumbs but don‚Äôt interact with them.
  **Optimization:** Consider whether breadcrumbs are necessary in the current navigation structure. They may be redundant if other navigation methods are more intuitive.

- üîÑ **Frequent Home Clicks?**
  ‚Üí Users might be struggling to find their way back.
  **Optimization:** Review site structure and ensure proper linking between categories.

- üîÅ **More Back Button Usage Than Breadcrumb Clicks?**
  ‚Üí Users might prefer using browser navigation instead of breadcrumbs.
  **Optimization:** Make breadcrumbs more interactive and clearly indicate their functionality.

- üìâ **Low Intermediate Level Click Rate?**
  ‚Üí Users are not navigating up through breadcrumbs.
  **Optimization:** Ensure breadcrumbs are relevant for deep hierarchies and not just duplicating the main navigation.

By continuously monitoring these metrics, we can refine breadcrumb effectiveness, ensuring they support seamless navigation and reduce friction in user journeys.

## Code Examples

### Basic Implementation

This example uses semantic HTML to provide a clear structure for the breadcrumb navigation.

```html
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://example.com">
        <span>Home</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://example.com/products">
        <span>Products</span>
      </a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span aria-current="page">Current Page</span>
    </li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```

### JSON-LD Structured Data

This example demonstrates how to dynamically generate the breadcrumb JSON-LD structured Data using JavaScript.

```javascript
const breadcrumbs = [
  { title: "Home", url: "https://example.com" },
  { title: "Products", url: "https://example.com/products" },
  { title: "Current Page" },
];

function generateBreadcrumbSchema(breadcrumbs) {
  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
    itemListElement: breadcrumbs.map((crumb, index) => {
      const isLastItem = index === breadcrumbs.length - 1;

      const baseItem = {
        "@type": "ListItem",
        position: index + 1,
        name: crumb.title,
      };

      // Only add the "item" property if it's not the last item and has a URL
      if (!isLastItem && crumb.url) {
        baseItem.item = crumb.url;
      }

      return baseItem;
    }),
  };
}
```

## SEO

### Structured Data

- Implement breadcrumb structured data using [Schema.org markup](https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList) to help search engines understand your site's hierarchy
- This improves the way your site appears in search results and helps search engines better understand your content structure
  Example JSON-LD structured data:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://example.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Products",
      "item": "https://example.com/products"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Current Page"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing & Validation

- Use Google's [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to validate structured data
- Monitor breadcrumb appearance in search results through Google Search Console
- Check for proper indexing of breadcrumb pages in site architecture
- Verify mobile rendering of breadcrumbs for mobile-first indexing
