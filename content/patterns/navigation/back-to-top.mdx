# Back to Top

## Overview

**Back to Top** provides users a quick way to return to the top of the page, especially when they have scrolled through lengthy or [infinite content](/patterns/navigation/infinite-scroll).

Commonly seen as a floating button or link at the bottom-right corner, it improves navigation and overall user experience.

/>

## Use Cases

### When to use:

Use **Back to Top** when you need to **help users quickly return to the top of a long page without excessive scrolling**.

**Common scenarios include:**

- On long or content-heavy pages where the user is likely to scroll far down
- When quick navigation back to the header or navigation menu is essential
- In blogs, documentation pages, or e-commerce category listings with extensive scroll

### When not to use:

- On very short pages where scrolling is minimal or unnecessary
- If your layout or design already provides persistent navigation at the bottom (navigation at the bottom) or top (sticky menus)
- When infinite scrolling is not used (or scrolling is minimal and not an issue)

### Common scenarios and examples

- Long editorial content (articles, guides, and blog posts)
- Content hubs or portals with extensive listings
- FAQ pages with collapsible or expanded sections
- Dashboards or analytics pages containing large data tables
- Infinite scrolling experiences (e.g., social feeds) to let users quickly jump to the top

## Benefits

- Enhances user navigation and usability on long pages
- Improves overall site accessibility by giving a direct route to main navigation
- Reduces scrolling fatigue for mobile users
- Helps maintain a clean UI by hiding controls when not needed, then showing them once the user scrolls down

## Drawbacks

- **Not always necessary** – If pages are short, the button may be redundant.
- **Can be disruptive** – Sudden jumps to the top may disorient users.
- **Visibility control** – Requires logic to appear only after a certain scroll depth.
- **Potential for hidden functionality** – Users may not notice it or understand its purpose.
- **Inconsistent placement** – Can interfere with floating UI elements if not positioned carefully.

end
```

### Component Structure

1. **Container**

- A clickable element (usually a button) that triggers scrolling to the top
- Often positioned as a floating element on desktop and mobile
- Manages focus states and accessibility attributes

2. **Icon (Optional)**

- Conveys the action of going to the top (e.g., an up arrow)
- Should be clear and universally recognized
- Must be sized for good readability (16×16px or 24×24px are common)
- Color should contrast with the background

3. **Label Text (Optional)**

- Helps clarify the action for screen readers or when the icon alone isn't sufficient
- Typically hidden for visually oriented users, but available to assistive technology
- Could be visible if design requires additional clarity

4. **Visual States**

- **Default**: Visible when the user scrolls past a certain threshold
- **Hover**: Provides a visual cue (e.g. change in background color)
- **Active**: Pressed or clicked state
- **Focus**: Outline or highlight for keyboard navigation
- **Hidden**: Button is invisible or removed when the user is near the top of the page

#### **Summary of Components**

| Component     | Required? | Purpose                                                     |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Container     | ✅ Yes    | Clickable element that triggers scrolling to the top.       |
| Icon          | ❌ No     | Visual indicator (e.g., an up arrow) for quick recognition. |
| Label Text    | ❌ No     | Provides additional clarity, especially for screen readers. |
| Visual States | ✅ Yes    | Defines interaction states (hover, active, focus, hidden).  |

## Best Practices

### Content

**Do's ✅**

- Show a clear visual indicator (usually an up arrow icon)
- Display the button only after the user scrolls a predetermined distance
- Hide it when the user is near the top of the page
- Use an accessible label (e.g., `aria-label="Back to top"`) if the text is omitted

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't make it permanently visible for short pages—it can be distracting
- Don't use vague icons or labels (e.g., a random symbol without context)
- Don't crowd the button with other floating elements
- Don't rely solely on color for states—use shape or text changes if possible

### Accessibility

**Do's ✅**

- Ensure the button is keyboard-focusable and can be activated via Enter or Space
- Provide sufficient color contrast between the button and its background
- Use an appropriate aria-label or descriptive text for screen readers
- Manage focus: after scrolling up, keep the user informed or maintain logical focus

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't hide it behind complex interactions or animations
- Don't place it in a position that overlaps other important UI elements
- Don't disable focus outlines without providing an alternative focus style

### Visual Design

**Do's ✅**

- Use a large enough icon or label for quick recognition (minimum 16×16px icon)
- Maintain consistent styling with the rest of your UI (color, shape, corners)
- Incorporate hover/focus states that match your design system guidelines
- Place it in a fixed position (often bottom-right) for easy access

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't block important content with a floating button
- Don't make the button so small that it's hard to tap on mobile
- Don't use misleading icons (ensure the arrow is pointing up)

### Mobile & Touch Considerations

**Do's ✅**

- Use a minimum touch target of 44×44px
- Keep it within thumb-friendly zones at the bottom of the screen
- Make sure it doesn't overlap interactive elements (navigation drawers, chat bubbles)
- Add any necessary spacing from device edges to avoid accidental swipes

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't place it in corners difficult to reach on large screens
- Don't rely on hover states for mobile users—visual changes should appear on tap/press
- Don't crowd the bottom area with too many floating icons

### Layout & Positioning

**Do's ✅**

- Fix its position to the viewport so it remains visible during scrolling
- Use consistent margin or spacing from edges for aesthetic alignment
- Keep in mind other fixed UI elements such as sticky footers or chat widgets

**Don'ts ❌**

- Don't move it around the page as the user scrolls
- Don't tie it to an element that scrolls out of view

## Interactive Example

Experience the Back to Top pattern in action:

<Playground patternType="navigation" pattern="back-to-top" example="basic" height="700px" />

This example showcases:
- Smooth scroll animation to top
- Button appears after scrolling 300px
- Fade-in/out transitions for button visibility
- Progress bar showing scroll position
- Throttled scroll events for performance
- Keyboard support (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to activate)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- Mobile-optimized touch targets

## Performance

### Performance Metrics

**Target Metrics:**

- **Scroll trigger threshold**: Show after 2x viewport height (or ~1000px)
- **Scroll animation duration**: 300-500ms for smooth feel
- **Button fade-in**: < 200ms transition
- **Interaction delay**: < 50ms response to click
- **Frame rate**: Maintain 60fps during scroll animation

**Scroll Performance:**

- **Throttle scroll events**: Check position every 100-150ms (not on every scroll)
- **Use Intersection Observer**: More performant than scroll listeners
- **Passive event listeners**: Add `{ passive: true }` to scroll handlers
- **RAF for animations**: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling

**Visibility Optimization:**

- **CSS transitions**: Use for show/hide animations (not JavaScript)
- **Transform + opacity**: Animate these properties for GPU acceleration
- **Will-change**: Apply sparingly to button during transitions
- **Avoid reflows**: Don't change layout properties during animations

**Mobile Performance:**

- **Touch responsiveness**: < 100ms feedback on tap
- **Reduced motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- **Scroll behavior**: Use native CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` when possible
- **Battery impact**: Minimize continuous animations

## Code Examples

### Basic Implementation (HTML + minimal JS)

```html
<button type="button" class="js-back-to-top" aria-label="Back to top" hidden>
  ↑
</button>

<script>
  // Basic scroll logic
  const backToTopBtn = document.querySelector(".js-back-to-top");
  const scrollThreshold = 300; // in px

  function backToTop() {
    if (window.scrollY > scrollThreshold) {
      backToTopBtn.removeAttribute("hidden");
    } else {
      backToTopBtn.setAttribute("hidden", "");
    }
  }

  function scrollToTop() {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" });
  }

  document.addEventListener("scroll", toggleBackToTop);
  backToTopBtn.addEventListener("click", scrollToTop);
</script>
```

## Accessibility

### ARIA Attributes

**Required ARIA attributes:**

- Use `aria-label="Back to top"` if using icon-only buttons
- Use `aria-hidden="true"` on the icon if text is included for screen readers
- Use `hidden` or `aria-hidden="true"` to hide the button when not needed

### Screen Reader Support

```html
<!-- Icon-only button with ARIA label -->
<button type="button" aria-label="Back to top" hidden>
  <svg aria-hidden="true">
    <use href="#icon-arrow-up" />
  </svg>
</button>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

- Must be focusable and activated with both Enter and Space keys
- The user should be able to tab to it if it's visible
- Focus outlines should remain intact for accessibility
- Maintaining focus after click is optional; the scroll event is generally the key feedback
