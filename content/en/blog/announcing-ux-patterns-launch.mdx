For over 15 years, I've worked alongside web and UX designers to refine user experiences.

I'm introducing today my new open-source resource filled with proven UX patterns, practical code snippets, and actionable tips - empowering developers to build more accessible and user-friendly interfaces.

For the incoming weeks, I will be adding new patterns to the collection and try to be as consistent as possible. This will be a continuous process without any specific deadline.

## Why "UX Patterns for Developers"?

I've been using the term "UX Patterns" for a long time now. In discussions with other developers or colleagues because for me, defining the actually UX patterns helps in the creation of UI components.

I've encountered many people jumping in creating a component without fully understanding the UX pattern behind it. I've also seen many developers creating components that are not UX patterns, but rather a singular vision of a UI component. This creates a lot of risks.

With "UX Patterns for Developers", I'm trying to create a resource that will help developers understand the UX patterns behind UI components and take into all aspects of creating new components - SEO, Accessibility, Usability, Performance, and more.

## How to use "UX Patterns for Developers"?

To this day, the collection is divided into two main sections:

- Layout & Navigation
- Inputs & Forms
- Content Management
- User Feedback

This will certainly change in the future, but for now, it's a good starting point.

Each section contains a set of UX patterns that can be used to build UI components. Each pattern is divided into three main sections:

1. **Overview** - Introduction and use cases for the pattern
2. **Use Cases** - Real-world examples and scenarios where the pattern should be implemented
3. **Benefits** - Key advantages and value propositions of using this pattern
4. **Anatomy** - Detailed breakdown of the component's structure
5. **Best Practices** - Guidelines for implementation, including do's and don'ts
6. **Code Examples** - Code examples and technical considerations
7. **Accessibility** - Guidelines for accessibility considerations
8. **SEO** - Search engine optimization considerations and best practices
9. **Browser Support** - Information on browser support for the pattern
10. **Testing** - Guidelines for unit, integration, and accessibility testing
11. **Resources** - Additional documentation, articles, libraries...

Each pattern also contains a set of resources, including articles and libraries.
