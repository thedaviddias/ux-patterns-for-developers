## How Would We Define "Build Effort"?

Each pattern has a complexity indicator using this simple scale:

| Level     | Description                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Low    | Simple implementation, minimal dependencies, little to no JavaScript required (e.g., Tooltip, Expandable Text).                       |
| 🟡 Medium | Requires state management, user interactions, and accessibility considerations (e.g., Load More, Modal).                              |
| 🔴 High   | Complex UI behavior, animations, accessibility, performance optimizations, and multiple edge cases (e.g., Carousel, Infinite Scroll). |
