## About UX Patterns for Devs

UX Patterns for Devs is a comprehensive resource that helps developers implement effective, accessible, and usable UI components. Each pattern in our documentation is carefully crafted to provide practical guidance while following best practices for user experience and accessibility.

<Callout type="info">
  This project is actively maintained and new patterns are added regularly.

1. **Browse Patterns** - Use the sidebar navigation to explore available patterns
2. **Search** - Use the search bar to find specific patterns or concepts
3. **Implementation** - Follow the code examples and guidelines for each pattern
4. **Accessibility** - Pay attention to accessibility requirements for each component
5. **Best Practices** - Review the do's and don'ts before implementing

## How Would We Define "Build Effort"?

Each pattern has a complexity indicator using this simple scale:

| Level     | Description                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸŸ¢ Low    | Simple implementation, minimal dependencies, little to no JavaScript required (e.g., Tooltip, Expandable Text).                       |
| ðŸŸ¡ Medium | Requires state management, user interactions, and accessibility considerations (e.g., Load More, Modal).                              |
| ðŸ”´ High   | Complex UI behavior, animations, accessibility, performance optimizations, and multiple edge cases (e.g., Carousel, Infinite Scroll). |
