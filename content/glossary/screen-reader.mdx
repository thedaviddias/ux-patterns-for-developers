# Screen Reader

A screen reader is assistive technology software that interprets what's displayed on a computer screen and converts it to speech (text-to-speech) or braille output. Screen readers enable people who are blind, have low vision, or have reading difficulties to use computers and access digital content.

## How Screen Readers Work

Screen readers analyze the Document Object Model (DOM) and accessibility tree to understand page structure and content. They then:
1. Convert text to synthesized speech
2. Announce interactive elements and their states
3. Provide navigation shortcuts
4. Communicate visual information through audio cues

## Popular Screen Readers

### Desktop
- **NVDA** (Windows) - Free, open-source
- **JAWS** (Windows) - Commercial, widely used in enterprise
- **VoiceOver** (macOS/iOS) - Built into Apple devices
- **Narrator** (Windows) - Built into Windows

### Mobile
- **VoiceOver** (iOS) - Native iOS screen reader
- **TalkBack** (Android) - Native Android screen reader
- **Voice Assistant** (Samsung devices)

## Key Features

### Navigation Modes
- **Browse Mode**: Read content linearly
- **Focus Mode**: Interact with forms and controls
- **Table Mode**: Navigate data tables cell by cell
- **Scan Mode**: Quick navigation in Windows

### Shortcuts & Commands
Screen readers provide keyboard shortcuts for:
- Jumping between headings (H key)
- Moving between landmarks (D key)
- Listing all links (Insert + F7 in NVDA)
- Finding specific text
- Reading from current position

## Web Development Considerations

### Semantic HTML
Use proper HTML elements to convey meaning:
```html
<!-- Good -->
<button>Submit</button>
<nav>...</nav>
<h1>Page Title</h1>

<!-- Bad -->
<div onclick="submit()">Submit</div>
<div class="navigation">...</div>
<div class="big-text">Page Title</div>
```

### ARIA Labels and Descriptions
Provide context when visual cues aren't enough:
```html
<button aria-label="Close dialog">×</button>
<input aria-describedby="password-help">
<p id="password-help">Must be at least 8 characters</p>
```

### Alternative Text
Describe images meaningfully:
```html
<!-- Informative image -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% in Q4">

<!-- Decorative image -->
<img src="divider.png" alt="" role="presentation">
```

### Focus Management
Ensure logical tab order and visible focus indicators:
```css
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Show focus ring only when appropriate */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

## Testing with Screen Readers

### Quick Testing
1. **Enable screen reader** (Cmd+F5 for VoiceOver on Mac)
2. **Navigate with keyboard only** - no mouse
3. **Listen to content** - does it make sense?
4. **Check announcements** - are states and changes announced?
5. **Test forms** - can you complete them?

### Common Issues to Check
- Missing labels on form fields
- Buttons without accessible names
- Images without alt text
- Dynamic content changes not announced
- Complex widgets lacking ARIA attributes
- Illogical heading hierarchy

## Screen Reader Usage Statistics

According to WebAIM's Screen Reader User Survey:
- **JAWS**: 53.7% (Windows)
- **NVDA**: 30.7% (Windows)
- **VoiceOver**: 6.5% (macOS)
- **VoiceOver iOS**: 6.1% (Mobile)

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Test with real screen readers, not just automated tools
- Use semantic HTML before adding ARIA
- Provide skip links for repetitive content
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Announce dynamic content changes with live regions
- Write descriptive link text ("Read more about pricing" not "Click here")

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Avoid using placeholder text as labels
- Don't auto-play media with sound
- Never trap keyboard focus (except in modals)
- Don't use ARIA to fix bad HTML

## Common Announcements

Understanding what screen readers announce helps design better interfaces:

| Element | Typical Announcement |
|---------|---------------------|
| `<button>` | "Submit, button" |
| `<a href>` | "Contact us, link" |
| `<h1>` | "Heading level 1, Welcome" |
| `<nav>` | "Navigation landmark" |
| `aria-expanded="false"` | "collapsed" |
| `aria-live="polite"` | Announces changes |
| `disabled` | "dimmed" or "disabled" |
