# Comment System

User comments and discussion threads

## What it solves

A **Comment System** pattern helps teams create a reliable way to support threaded discussion around content while keeping moderation, authorship, and recovery visible. It is most useful when teams need article and discussion comments.
Compared with adjacent patterns, this pattern should reduce friction without hiding the state, rules, or recovery paths people need to keep moving.

## When to use

- Article and discussion comments
- Team review threads
- Support and community conversations

## When to avoid

- Avoid social or engagement mechanics when they do not create real user value.
- Do not add public counts or visibility states without understanding the trust implications.
- Do not ship the surface without moderation, abuse, or reversal planning.

## Implementation workflow

1. Confirm the pattern matches the problem and constraints before copying the example.
2. Start from the anatomy and examples in `references/pattern.md`, then choose the smallest viable variation.
3. Apply accessibility, performance, and interaction guardrails before layering visual polish.
4. Use the testing guidance to verify behavior across keyboard, screen reader, responsive, and failure scenarios.

## Accessibility guardrails

### Keyboard Interaction
- [ ] Verify that comment system can be completed using keyboard alone.
- [ ] Keep focus order logical when the pattern opens, updates, or reveals additional UI.
- [ ] Preserve a visible focus state that is still readable at high zoom.
### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Use semantic elements first, then add ARIA only where semantics alone are not enough.
- [ ] Announce state changes such as errors, loading, or completion in the right place and with the right politeness.
- [ ] Connect labels, hints, and status text with `aria-describedby` or structural headings when useful.
### Visual Accessibility
- [ ] Do not rely on color alone to convey severity, completion, or selection state.

## Common mistakes

### **Treating trust as secondary UI**

**The Problem:**
Counts, totals, identities, and policies are often the main thing users are checking before acting.

**How to Fix It?**
Design trust signals into the main hierarchy instead of leaving them as tiny secondary text.

### **Over-optimizing for the first click**

**The Problem:**
Aggressive prompts can increase taps while harming completion quality or long-term trust.

**How to Fix It?**
Measure the full journey, including reversals, refunds, reports, and hidden dissatisfaction.

### **Ignoring abuse and fraud paths**

**The Problem:**
Social and commerce surfaces invite misuse as soon as they create visible value.

**How to Fix It?**
Plan rate limits, authorization checks, moderation, and audit trails as part of the pattern itself.
